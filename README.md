# My Own Flutter Route
## This is my own daily flutter learning.
- ***What learned**
- Day 1
    - Variables (final vs val), null safety (? vs !!).

- Day 2
    - Core Widgets (Like Jetpack Compose)
    - Text, Column, Row, Container.
    - Recreate a simple Android layout in Flutter. (Example: A LinearLayout with a TextView and Button.)
